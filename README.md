Arduino-Robotic-Arm
===================

Simple robotic arm that is open source and controlled by an arduino

The Included file contains the code needed to run the program and you should note that
I modified the program to run 4 servos with 1 being the base, 2 being the arms, and 1 being the claw.
The arms move together in unison due to a modification of the program. You will also need an arduino that is capable of providing support for 3 or 4 servos depending on how many you decided to use. For a full guide follow my account on
